Hey,
This is me solving some problems found on various platforms.

main.cpp is the source code.
question is commented on top of the source code.
input.txt contains the sample input.
output.txt contains the sample output.

Solution design:

    Solution of the problem is in the class called Problem.
    Variables used in the problem are declared as private attributes of class Problem.
    
    There are 4 public functions in the class Problem.
    1. Constructor - Used to initialize the required Variables.
    2. Read_input() - Used to read the input.
    3. Solve() - This function will solve the problem.
    4. Print_output() - This function prints the solution of the problem.

Exicuting (in linux):

    g++ main.cpp
to compile the code and to generate object code.

    cat input.txt | ./a.out
to run with the sample input.

Input format:

    <no of test cases>
    <input for 1st case>
    <input for 2nd case>
    <input for ... case>
    <input for nth case>

Output format:

    case #1: <output of case 1>
    case #2: <output of case 2>
    case #..: <output of case ..>
    case #n: <output of case n>

Thank you...
