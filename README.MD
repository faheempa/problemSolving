Hey,
This is me solving some problems found on various platforms.

Problem is commented on top of the main file & the function solve() is the solution.

Exicuting (in linux):

    g++ main.cpp && cat input.txt | ./a.out
This will generate object code and run with the sample input.

Input format:

    <no of test cases>
    <input for 1st case>
    <input for 2nd case>
    <input for ... case>
    <input for nth case>

Output format:

    case #1: <output of case 1>
    case #2: <output of case 2>
    case #..: <output of case ..>
    case #n: <output of case n>

Thank you...
