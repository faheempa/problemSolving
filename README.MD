Hey,
This is me solving some problems found on various platforms.

main.cpp is the source code.
question is commented on top of the source code.
input.txt contains the sample input.
output.txt contains the sample output.

Solution design:

    Solution of the problem is in the class called Problem.
    Variables used in the problem are declared as private attributes of class Problem.
    
    There are 4 public functions in the class Problem.
    1. Problem() - Constructor used to initialize the required Variables.
    2. Input() - Used to read the input(s).
    3. Solve() - Solution to the problem.
    4. Output() - Prints the output(s).

Exicuting (in linux):

    g++ main.cpp && cat input.txt | ./a.out
This will generate object code and run with the sample input.

Input format:

    <no of test cases>
    <input for 1st case>
    <input for 2nd case>
    <input for ... case>
    <input for nth case>

Output format:

    case #1: <output of case 1>
    case #2: <output of case 2>
    case #..: <output of case ..>
    case #n: <output of case n>

Thank you...
